- Checks for S3 bucket availability, DynamoDB table existence, and managed IPAM pools.
- Prints "All checks passed. Continuing with the program" if all checks pass.
- Prints "One or more checks failed. Exiting the program." and exits with an error code if any check fails.
- Defines commented-out code for assuming an AWS role using STS and validating AWS configuration.
- Defines a class `AWSResourceTagChecker` with methods for checking tags on various AWS resources.
- Private method `_check_resource_tag` checks if resources of a specified type have a specified tag.
- Public methods (`check_instance_tag`, `check_vpc_tag`, `check_subnet_tag`, `check_alb_tag`) use `_check_resource_tag`.
- Example usage checks for a specific tag on EC2 instance, VPC, Subnet, and ALB.
- Prints results and exits with an error code if any check returns True.
- Provides a summary indicating whether any resources have the specified tag.
- Placeholder comment for additional script logic.
 
**Script for S3 Bucket Creation and File Operations:**
 
- Defines local and S3 paths for RPM file, S3 bucket name, and S3 key.
- Defines a bucket policy to deny non-SSL requests.
- Initializes an S3 client, checks if the bucket exists, creates it, and sets the bucket policy if not.
- Creates a local directory if it doesn't exist.
- Checks if the RPM file exists in S3; if not, downloads and uploads it.
- Uploads the `inputs.conf` file to S3.
- Updates a GitHub environment file with AWS region and S3 bucket name.
- Prints a summary indicating the completion of various steps.
 
**Script for Creating tfvars JSON File:**
 
- Defines code mappings for environment, instance, product, and worker type codes.
- Uses `argparse` to parse a command-line argument for the configuration path.
- Loads configuration data from the specified JSON file.
- Sets up AWS credentials and region based on the loaded configuration.
- Generates unique names for instances based on specified format and mappings.
- Configures root and data volumes, load balancer parameters, and worker type counts.
- Constructs a dictionary for generating Terraform variable (tfvars) files.
- Writes the generated JSON data to a tfvars file.
- Outputs a tfvars file containing configuration details for Terraform.
 
**Script for Updating JSON:**
 
- Loads configuration data from the specified JSON file.
- Defines a function `repair_json` to remove trailing commas in arrays and objects.
- Reads updated Terraform JSON data from `/tmp/terraform/terraform.json`.
- Calls functions (`collecting_subnets` and `security_group`) from the `subnets` module.
- Creates dictionaries to map worker types to subnets and security groups.
- Iterates through instances and updates subnets and security groups based on mappings.
- Saves updated JSON data to `/tmp/terraform/terraform.tfvars.json`.
- Reads content of updated tfvars file, replaces single quotes with double quotes.
- Attempts to load the JSON data, and if decoding fails, tries to repair the JSON.
- Writes the repaired or original JSON data to `/tmp/terraform/output.json`.
